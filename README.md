# BOTANICAL SEARCH

The aim of Botanical Search is to provide a fun challange to its users. The quiz asks users to use their keen eye to find items or features 
of the botanical garden in the picture provided. The challange that Botanical Search provides for users will bring a sense of accomplishment 
when they guess correctly, and if they don't succeed the first time, they can try again and again until they have succeeded. As well as being
a fun quiz, this kind of challange enables users to exercies their brain which is important for a healthy lifestyle. The timer brings another
element of competition to the quiz for users which makes it even more enjoyable.

The target audience for Botanical search is adults of all ages who have an interest in nature, and especially in the botanical
gardens around the world.
