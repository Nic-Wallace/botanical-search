# BOTANICAL SEARCH

The aim of Botanical Search is to provide a fun challange to its users. The quiz asks users to use their keen eye to find items or features 
of the botanical garden in the picture provided. The challange that Botanical Search provides for users will bring a sense of accomplishment 
when they guess correctly, and if they don't succeed the first time, they can try again and again until they have succeeded. As well as being
a fun quiz, this kind of challange enables users to exercies their brain which is important for a healthy lifestyle. The timer brings another
element of competition to the quiz for users which makes it even more enjoyable.

The target audience for Botanical search is adults of all ages who have an interest in nature, and especially in the botanical
gardens around the world.

## UX

Botanical Search was designed around the colours of the monarch butterfly, which is frequently seen in botanical gardens. 
The quiz is kept in the center of the page so everything is clearly visible to the user and there are no distractions away from the quiz.

### Colour Scheme

- `#000000` used for primary text.
- `#FFA500` used for primary highlights.
- `#FF7900` used for secondary highlights.

### Typography

- [Source Serif Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Serif+Pro) was used for the primary headers and titles.

- [Jacques Francois](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Jacques+Francois) was used for all other secondary text.

## Features

### Existing Features

- **Heading**

    - The heading of Botanical Search is the same across the pages, this is to let the user know that they are still on the same website. 
    The logo either side of it matches the favicon, keeping the theme of the quiz visible and cohesive. The heading is also a link back to 
    the home page where the rules are listed if the user needs to refresh their memory of how the quiz works.
